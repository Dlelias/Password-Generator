PASSWORD-GENERATOR
## Description
In this project I created a random password generator. The generator will produce a random password containing an unordered array of numbers, upper and lower case letters, and special charaters. The generated passwords can have a length of 8 to 128 characters. The generator has input validation so the user must meet the required criteria in order to generate the random password desired. 

## Usage
The user is first meet with a password generator box in which they are prompted to select the desired password length between 8 and 128. If the user selected a number below 8 or over 128 the user will be alerted to input a number between 8 to 128. 

Once a length is selected . The user will then be asked if they would like to use lower case letters in the password, if the user selects okay they will be prompted to the second prompt. 

The second prompt will ask the user if they would like to use upper case letters, if the user selects okay they will be prompted to the thrid prompt.

At the thrid prompt the user will be asked if they would like to use special characters, if the user selects okay they will be prompted to the fourth and final prompt. 

Note: if the user does not select any of the require criteria they will be alerted to select at least one of the requirements. 

Once the final prompt appears the user will be asked if the would like to use numbers, if the user selected okay a random password meeting the criteria will appear in the box generator .
